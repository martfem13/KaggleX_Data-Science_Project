        "- This project aims at building a Machine Learning Model that is capable of predicting the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease in an observed patient. This is entirely a Machine learning classification task which falls under binary classification.  Meaning, we would only have two possible predictions of our observation thus \"yes\" or \"no\" as to whether  chronic kidney disease is present in an observed patient or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In this project, our machine learning model will be trained to classify each new observation introduced to it. Model will do this by making inferences on the trianed data set (looking at similarity of attributes) in order to build a predictive model for our analysis.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Dataset was further gathered to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing patients for the predicting of chronic kidney disease in their system. Each entry represents a distinct patient who underwent diagnosis, had their relevant information recorded and documented.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Subsequently, using the testing data, we will evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy. This crucial step allows us to assess the practical effectiveness of our machine learning model.\n",

        "We will then test the model with new data labels which we will generate in the course of our analysis and observe the accuracy of the prediction of our model on unseen or future data.\n",

In the dataset, we have 25 attributes of different patient's laboratory test to assess the behavior of these patients. Model will intend learn these patterns that are on each observation to aid it to make predictions on new data points. Scatterplot visualizations are applied to the dataset to extract more information about our data in our quest to build an ml model for prediction analysis.\n",

Outcome proved that, model accurately predicted new data points with a k-nearest classifier score of 85% on test data. An f1 score of 0.625 on test data is a good balance to assess our model's performance since our model misclassified about 15% of samples. From this project, we can conclude that machine learning models (in the case of classification) can be used to predict diseases such as chronic kidney disease in patients.\n",
