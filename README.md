# KaggleX Data Science Project

This is a documentation on a project I undertook in the KaggleX program. 
This project is about building a Machine Learning model that detects the presence or absence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in observed patients.
In doing this I endeavor to deploy relevant Machine Learning Model techniques to aid with analysing my dataset.

# Deployment #
1. Get data set (Kaggle data set/UCI Machine Learning website)
