# KaggleX Data Science Project

This is a documentation on a project I undertook in the KaggleX program. 
This project is about building a Machine Learning model that detects the presence or absence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in observed patients.
In doing this I endeavor to deploy relevant Machine Learning Model techniques to aid with analysing my dataset.

# Deployment #
1. Get data set (Kaggle data set/UCI Machine Learning website)
  *Note* You can explore these links to work on more practice data
   Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
   UCL ML https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/course/2022/COMSCIM146?siteYear=2022
   Art and Science website https://artofstat.com/datasets
2. Neccessary libraries are imported to help us analyse the dataset
3. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (Data set is explored to get more insights from it)
4. Scatter plot visualizations are build to create meaningful visualization form data set

# Analysis
The data set outputs 0's and 1's with 0's representing all observed patients with no Chronic Kidney Disease and 1's representing all observed patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. 
For our dataset, we have a total of 158 enteries of observed patients with records or technically attributes such as blood pressure, albumin, specific gravity, red blood cells, white blood cells, age, pus cell, Sodium creatinine, pus cell clumps, bacteria, blood glucose random, sodium, potassium, haemoglobin, anemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, appetite, class, blood urea, age, etc

# Machine Learning Models (Before Model Deployment)
1. Before machine learning models are built, let us look at a process flow which takes place

In our dataset, there are the x-cordinates and the y-cordinates. Updating
